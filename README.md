## Project Background
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.4.
This project focused on creating Friendly Chat, a real-time chat application built with Angular and Firebase. Using AngularFire, the app integrated Firebase services such as Firestore for real-time messaging, Authentication for secure user access, Storage for image uploads, and Hosting for deployment. The goal was to develop a user-friendly and scalable platform while gaining hands-on experience with Firebase's capabilities. Key features included real-time data updates, secure authentication workflows, and file handling, with a strong emphasis on best practices for security and performance. This project showcased the efficiency of combining Firebase and Angular for modern web application development.

## Discussion
Completing the Firebase Web Codelab series and building Friendly Chat was both a challenging and rewarding experience. It introduced me to Firebaseâ€™s powerful tools, such as Firestore for real-time data, Authentication for secure user access, and Storage for handling image uploads, all integrated seamlessly with Angular using AngularFire. 

During the development process, I faced several errors that provided valuable learning opportunities. One issue was the chat messages not appearing immediately after being sent, which I resolved by debugging Firestore listeners and ensuring proper reactive subscriptions. Another challenge was the inability to send images, caused by incorrect file handling and storage references, which I addressed by revisiting Firebase Storage documentation. Lastly, messages not saving in Firestore highlighted the importance of aligning security rules with user authentication, teaching me the critical role of Firestore permissions in data management.

These challenges strengthened my debugging skills and deepened my understanding of real-time applications. Through this activity, I learned the value of systematic problem-solving and the importance of testing each feature thoroughly. The project demonstrated how Firebase simplifies backend operations, making it an excellent tool for building secure, scalable, and responsive web applications.
